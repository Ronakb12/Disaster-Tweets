# Disaster-Tweets
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time.

In this project, we to build a BERT model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t.
