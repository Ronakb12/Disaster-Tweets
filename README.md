# Disaster-Tweets
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programmatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies). But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are announcing a disaster. In this project, we build a BERT model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t.
